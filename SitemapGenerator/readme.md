# Sitemap Generator

The Sitemap Generator returns from AdaptCMS 2.0, writing links to all public areas of your site (articles, pages, media libraries, etc.) and submitting a sitemap/urllist to search engines.

## Installation

The Sitemap Generator plugin is included and installed by default, but if you delete it manually or picked the no-plugin install, then read below:

To install, first download the zip and unpack the folder inside into your 'app/Old_Plugins' folder - be sure to chmod this new folder to 755. Then login into your admin panel and click on 'Manage Plugins'. You should see this plugin listed and an option to install on the right side.
Simply click that and click continue on the install and everything should be done!
